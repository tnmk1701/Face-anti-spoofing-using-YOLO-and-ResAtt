# Face-anti-spoofing-using-YOLO-and-ResAtt
This is a project for the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course at HUS. With your research of face anti-spoofing, hopefully this project will assist you.

## Pipeline

The overall pipeline was proposed by us, inspired by the scientific research paper [Face Anti-Spoofing using Deep-Pixel-wise-Binary-Supervision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.04047v1) that has been published. For more details, you can refer to our report.

## How to run
```python ./Test_cam.py```
